# About The App

The project was created while learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Responsive Web Design from the book "Basics of Web Design HTML5 & CSS (5th Edition) by Terry Felke-Morris.

This is a very simple Pacific Trails Resort website, consisting of a home page, a yurt accommodation page, a contact form page for making reservations, and a page describing the activities available at the resort

Features:
- View resort video
- Send the booking form
- Show information about the report and available activities
- Display information about yurts and accommodation packages
